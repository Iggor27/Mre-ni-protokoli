# High-reliability network protocols and *VXLAN* technology
In this repository, I created different network topologies in the GNS3 software emulator to show the convergence speed of ***OSPF*** and ***VRRP*** protocols after the ethernet link failure. </br>
Aside from that, I configured VXLAN technology on ***VyOs*** routers serving as ***VXLAN*** endpoint (VTEP) and connected virtual machines (CentOs/RockyLinux) on different subnets to work as one cluster.
